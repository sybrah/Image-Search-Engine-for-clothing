# Image-Search-Engine-for-clothing
 To alleviate the frustration of looking for an image in a vast gallery of photos , we have developed this advanced image search engine. Designed specifically for retail boutiques, it allows users to effortlessly find available clothing items or similar ones, ensuring a seamless and efficient shopping experience.
This project is a search engine designed to retrieve specific images based on textual descriptions. It leverages advanced techniques in image captioning and vector representation to match user queries with relevant images. The main components of this project include setting up the environment, generating image captions, creating vector representations, building the search engine, and packaging the project with proper documentation.

### 1.Setup Environment
The first step is to create a virtual environment and install all the necessary libraries. This helps in managing dependencies and ensures that the project has all the required tools to run smoothly. Key libraries include:

**chromadb**: For storing and retrieving vector representations.
**tensorflow** and **torch**: For deep learning tasks.
**transformers**: For working with pre-trained models.
**pillow**: For image processing.
**numpy** and **scikit-learn**: For numerical computations and machine learning utilities.
### 2. Image Captioning
Next, you need to generate textual descriptions (captions) for each image in your dataset. This involves:

**Loading my clothing dataset.**
**Using a pre-trained image captioning model: BLIP , to automatically generate discription for each item in the dataset.**
**Storing these discriptions along with their corresponding original fully detailed item attribute**:  These captions will serve as a textual representation of the images and will be used in subsequent steps for search and retrieval.
3. Vector Representation
Once you have the captions, the next step is to convert these textual descriptions into vector representations. This process involves:

Using a transformer-based model like BERT or Sentence-BERT to transform the captions into high-dimensional vectors. These vectors capture the semantic meaning of the captions.
Storing these vectors in a vector database like ChromaDB. This allows for efficient similarity searches when users input queries.
### 4. Building the Search Engine
With the vector representations in place, you can now build the search engine. This involves:

Creating a function to process user queries by converting them into vectors using the same model that was used for the image captions.
Implementing a search function that compares the query vector against the stored image caption vectors. The search function uses similarity metrics to find the most relevant matches.
Retrieving and displaying the images corresponding to the top matching captions. This way, users can input a textual description and get back the images that best match their query.
### 5. Packaging and Documentation
The final step is to package the project and provide comprehensive documentation. This includes:

Creating a requirements.txt file listing all the libraries and their specific versions needed to run the project. This ensures that anyone setting up the project can easily install all dependencies.
Documenting the code thoroughly to explain how each part of the project works.
Providing usage instructions so that users know how to set up the environment, run the image captioning script, convert captions into vectors, and use the search function.
Including references to any external sources or inspirations that were used in the project.
## Summary
By following these steps, you will have built a robust image search engine that leverages state-of-the-art techniques in image captioning and vector representation. Users will be able to retrieve specific images based on textual descriptions, making it a powerful tool for applications that require efficient and accurate image search capabilities.
