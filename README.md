# Image-Search-Engine-for-clothing
 To alleviate the frustration of looking for an image in a vast gallery of photos , we have developed this advanced image search engine. Designed specifically for retail boutiques, it allows users to effortlessly find available clothing items or similar ones, ensuring a seamless and efficient shopping experience.
This project is a search engine designed to retrieve specific images based on textual descriptions. It leverages advanced techniques in image captioning and vector representation to match user queries with relevant images. The main components of this project include setting up the environment, generating image captions, creating vector representations, building the search engine, and packaging the project with proper documentation.

### 1.Setup Environment
The first step is to create a virtual environment and install all the necessary libraries. This helps in managing dependencies and ensures that the project has all the required tools to run smoothly. Key libraries include:

**chromadb**: For storing and retrieving vector representations.
**tensorflow** and **torch**: For deep learning tasks.
**transformers**: For working with pre-trained models.
**pillow**: For image processing.
**numpy** and **scikit-learn**: For numerical computations and machine learning utilities.
### 2. Image Captioning
Next, you need to generate textual descriptions (captions) for each image in your dataset. This involves:

**Loading my clothing dataset.**
**Using a pre-trained image captioning model: BLIP , to automatically generate discription for each item in the dataset.**
**Storing these discriptions along with their corresponding original fully detailed item attribute**:  These captions will serve as a textual representation of the images and will be used in subsequent steps for search and retrieval.
